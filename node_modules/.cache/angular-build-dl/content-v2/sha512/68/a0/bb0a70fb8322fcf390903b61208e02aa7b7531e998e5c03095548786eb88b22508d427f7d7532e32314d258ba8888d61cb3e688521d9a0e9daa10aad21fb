We provide four different types of test: Quantitative,\r\n      Verbal, Quiz, and Mock Tests. The Quantitative tests provides the users an\r\n      opportunity to excel their knowlege and understanding of mathematics. The\r\n      Verbal tests are used to test the skills of the person in the vocabulary\r\n      and understanding of the English language. The Quiz section is a mix of\r\n      Quantitative and Verbal tests where the questions are from both the\r\n      sections. These tests are not timed. Use the GREPrep Mock Test to help you\r\n      prepare for the computer-delivered GRE General Test. The mock tests are\r\n      designed to help you practice your test-taking strategies, such as time\r\n      management, by taking a test under timed conditions.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"parallax-container\">\r\n  <div class=\"parallax3\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: #e7ebee;\">\r\n  <div class=\"row container\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"header\">GRE Predictor and Attempt History</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3\">\r\n      We also have two features GRE Predictor and Attempt History. A GRE score\r\n      predictor will be introduced which works based on the student's\r\n      performance in the tests. The score every user gets in all the test\r\n      modules will be used by the GRE score predictor in generating the\r\n      predicted GRE score. University admits predictor which is based on users\r\n      predicted GRE score that comes up with chances of getting admit from a\r\n      university. These predictions are based on the highest mock test score of\r\n      the user. The predictions will help the user to focus on the schools that\r\n      give the user better chances of getting an admit. Along with the\r\n      predictor, we also have an attempt history feature, which allows the user\r\n      to view how the user has fared in the previous tests. The user can also\r\n      look at the answers that was provided during the tests using the View\r\n      Answers option. We will also mention the correct answers for each question\r\n      to the user.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"parallax-container\">\r\n    <div class=\"parallax4\"></div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: #e7ebee;\">\r\n    <div class=\"row container\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"header\">My Schools</h2>\r\n      <p class=\"grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3\">\r\n        Aspirants can add schools to this page as they start their preparation\r\n        and change their selection or move schools between different tables\r\n        whenever they feel the need to. Whenever people start preparing for\r\n        their GRE exam, they have a set target in their mind. They know which\r\n        schools they want to get into. As they move further in their\r\n        preparation, they get a much clearer picture as to which schools they\r\n        can get into easily and schools for which schools they need to work\r\n        hard. Before starting their GRE preparations, aspirants are suggested to\r\n        a mock test so that they could get to know how much effort they must put\r\n        into their preparations. Based on these marks they can even shortlist\r\n        schools as Dream, Reach and Safe. Dream schools are those schools for\r\n        which users must put in a lot of effort into their preparations. Reach\r\n        schools are the one for which users must put in adequate amount of\r\n        efforts. Safe schools are the one for which users are quite sure they\r\n        would get into with little efforts. The schools in these divisions are\r\n        bound to change as the preparation goes on. This will help them keep\r\n        their eye on the target.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<app-footer></app-footer>\r\n","import { Component, OnInit } from

The study plans\r\n            had a great focus on both verbal and quant, allowing for better\r\n            development of each skill. The practice questions were phenomenal.\r\n            Especially the interface was so simple that there was no extra\r\n            effort required, complete focus was on studies. I went through all\r\n            of the practice questions, and all of the quizzes, twice! I also\r\n            utilized the word lists provided that helped me to enhance my\r\n            vocabulary, and reading comprehensions solidified my readiness even\r\n            further. I improved my score by 12 points that was just amazing, and\r\n            I solely attribute this to GREPrep.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </mat-card>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"mat-elevation-z8\">\r\n        <mat-card>\r\n          <mat-card-header>\r\n            <div mat-card-avatar class=\"example-header-image\"></div>\r\n            <mat-card-title>Name: Kabir Singh </mat-card-title>\r\n            <mat-card-subtitle\r\n              >GRE SCORE BEFORE GREPrep: 311 <br />GRE Score After GREPrep:\r\n              329</mat-card-subtitle\r\n            >\r\n          </mat-card-header>\r\n          <p>\r\n            GREPrep is amazing. I went from not even knowing what the GRE was to\r\n            getting a great score in one month. I followed the 1 month study\r\n            plan and felt that GREPrep prepared me so well that I took my GRE a\r\n            month early and the result was astonishing. I got a 329 total, and\r\n            was so happy with my score I cried. I gave GRE before also by using\r\n            practice materials from other websites but after using GREPrep just\r\n            for one month my score increased by 18 points. GREPrep prepared me\r\n            so well, especially for the quant section which I really struggled\r\n            with in the beginning. They provide so great practice materials that\r\n            resemble the real GRE exam very closely and the mock test scores are\r\n            really the same as we get in the real GRE exam. I really can't thank\r\n            GREPrep enough. I came into GRE studying so nervous, clueless and\r\n            unprepared and came out with an amazing score I couldn't be happier\r\n            with.

If you are\r\n            preparing to take a GRE, GREPrep has to be the way. It is like a\r\n            one-stop-shop, which has all the materials one might need to ace in\r\n            GRE. The QUALITY of questions included in the study material are\r\n            unparalleled and are closest to the type and quality of questions\r\n            one sees in GRE. And if you are scared of the Verbal section, then\r\n            let me assure you, the materials are so well organized it will be a\r\n            piec of cakewalk. I had never given GRE exam before, so I was very\r\n            nervous since it was my first time. But after getting my score in\r\n            the mock test, my confidence was boosted, and trust me it was not\r\n            fake confidence since the actual score was exactly the same as the\r\n            score in the mock test. This proves that thier test is so accurate\r\n            to the real GRE examination. Moreover the best part of all, they\r\n            provide everything free of cost that is just superb. Thank you so\r\n            much GREPrep for helping me to get admit to my dream university.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </mat-card>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n","// Author - Padmesh Donthu\r\nimport { Component, OnInit, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { Question } from '../models/question';\r\nimport { QuestionManagerService } from '../services/question-manager.service';\r\nimport { QuestionConfig } from '../models/question-config';\r\nimport { UserAnswers } from '../models/user-answers';\r\nimport { Answers } from '../models/answers';\r\nimport { UserService } from '../services/user.service';\r\nimport { Router } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-take-mock-test',\r\n  templateUrl: './take-mock-test.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: [\r\n    '../../../node_modules/materialize-css/dist/css/materialize.min.css',\r\n    './take-mock-test.component.css',\r\n  ],\r\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated,\r\n})\r\nexport class TakeMockTestComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  // Class variables that are used in the html for reactivity\r\n  questions: Question[];\r\n  mode = 'quiz';\r\n  loading = true;\r\n\r\n  // Stores the final gre score based on the answers\r\n  greScore = 0;\r\n\r\n  // Stores all the user answers\r\n  userAnswers: UserAnswers = null;\r\n\r\n  // Setting the configuration for the Test\r\n  config: QuestionConfig = {\r\n    allowBack: true,\r\n    autoMove: false, // if true, it will move to next question automatically when answered.\r\n    duration: 7200, // indicates the time (in secs) in which quiz needs to be completed. 0 means unlimited.\r\n    pageSize: 1,\r\n    showClock: false,\r\n    showPager: true,\r\n    theme: 'none',\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // These attributes are used\r\n  pager = {\r\n    index: 0,\r\n    size: 1,\r\n    count: 1,\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // These attributes are used for creating a timer for the test\r\n  timer: any = null;\r\n  startTime: Date;\r\n  endTime: Date;\r\n  ellapsedTime = '00:00';\r\n  duration = '';\r\n\r\n  // Injecting services and router to the component\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private questionService: QuestionManagerService,\r\n    private userService: UserService,\r\n    private router: Router\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  // Gets all the questions available for the test when the component is initialised\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.loadQuestions();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Gets the questions for the quiz using the question service\r\n  loadQuestions() {\r\n    this.questionService.getQuestions().subscribe((data: Question[]) => {\r\n      this.questions = data;\r\n      this.loading = false;\r\n      this.pager.count = this.questions.length;\r\n      this.startTime = new Date();\r\n      this.ellapsedTime = '00:00';\r\n      this.timer = setInterval(() => {\r\n        this.tick();\r\n      }, 1000);\r\n      this.duration = this.parseTime(this.config.duration);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // A method which is used to increment the clock time\r\n  tick() {\r\n    const now = new Date();\r\n    const diff = (now.getTime() - this.startTime.getTime()) / 1000;\r\n    if (diff >= this.config.duration) {\r\n      this.onSubmit();\r\n    }\r\n    this.ellapsedTime = this.parseTime(diff);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Converts the seconds to minutes and seconds\r\n  parseTime(totalSeconds: number) {\r\n    let mins: string | number = Math.floor(totalSeconds / 60);\r\n    let secs: string | number = Math.round(totalSeconds % 60);\r\n    mins = (mins < 10 ?

min-height: 100%; background-color: #e7ebee;\">\r\n  <app-header></app-header>\r\n  <div class=\"heading\">Why Masters?</div>\r\n  <div class=\"content\">\r\n    There are various reasons that students choose to pursue a masters degree.\r\n    Every student has thier own reasons, however here we will provide the most\r\n    commons reasons that will boost the motivation level of the students to\r\n    pursue masters in thier corresponding fields. <br />\r\n    <b>FINANCIAL GAIN</b>: A student having bachelors degree and a student\r\n    having bachelors plus a masters degree have significant differences in their\r\n    payscale. Statistically speaking having a masters degree shows an average\r\n    25% increase in the payscale of the students. So if a student applies for a\r\n    job in a given company, then they will get almost 25% more salary if they\r\n    have a masters degree as compared to a student who has only bachelors\r\n    degree. So why not put little effort, grab this opportunity and get those\r\n    extra bucks to ameliorate the quality of life. <br />\r\n    <b>CAREER ADVANCEMENT</b>: If a student has a masters degree in thier cv, it\r\n    makes a lot of difference in various ways. The way in which the employer\r\n    shortlists the candidates for a particular role, having masters adds an\r\n    extra advantage. Most students especially those who already have decent CVs\r\n    – do a masters to progress to the next stage in their career. This might\r\n    mean an MS in a field of interest, or even something totally unrelated if\r\n    the student is looking to change direction completely; either way, a masters\r\n    can be used as a very valuable stepping stone. Employers recognise the value\r\n    of a masters degree – some even make it a prerequisite, while in industries\r\n    such as healthcare and education, they are mandatory. But even in general\r\n    terms, a masters can set a student apart from the crowd.<br />\r\n    <b>SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE</b>: As the name suggests, masters means the student\r\n    will gain in depth knowledge of that particular stream. For instance a\r\n    student who has done masters in computer science will be an expert of\r\n    computer science. Doing masters will involve lot of hard work and learning\r\n    some very new concepts that a bachelors student will never know, and that\r\n    knowledge will provide a great advantage for the student to excel in getting\r\n    placements in some of the top employers of the world in thier field of\r\n    interest. <br />\r\n    <b>PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT</b>: A masters degree is not just about academic\r\n    achievement; it should also encourage personal development. A student learns\r\n    to manage time by doing assignments, presentations etc. A discipline is\r\n    required to achieve good grades if a student is pursuing masters from a\r\n    reputed university. There are many qualities that a student inculcates while\r\n    doing masters like patience, accuracy, discipline, academic integrity and\r\n    many more. By their definition, postgraduate courses are very autonomous,\r\n    with much of the emphasis on the individual themselves to put things in\r\n    motion, and this helps in overall personality development of the individual.\r\n    <br />\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n","// This file can be replaced during build by using the `fileReplacements` array.\r\n// `ng build --prod` replaces `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts`.\r\n// The list of file replacements can be found in `angular.json`.\r\n\r\nexport const environment = {\r\n  production: true,\r\n  apiBaseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080'\r\n};\r\n\r\n/*\r\n * For easier debugging in development mode, you can import the following file\r\n * to ignore zone related error stack frames such as `zone.run`, `zoneDelegate.invokeTask`.\r\n *\r\n * This import should be commented out in production mode because it will have a negative impact\r\n * on performance if an error is thrown.\r\n */\r\n// import 'zone.js/dist/zone-error';  // Included with Angular CLI.\r\n","import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\r\n\r\nimport { AppModule } from './app/app.module';\r\nimport { environment } from './environments/environment';\r\n\r\nif (environment.production) {\r\n  enableProdMode();\r\n}\r\n\r\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)\r\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));\r\n"]}
